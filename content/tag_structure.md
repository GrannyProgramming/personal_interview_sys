## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Tag Assignment Protocol
1. **Primary Stage**: Always assign exactly one S[N]_ stage tag
2. **Topic Classification**: Assign 1-3 topic tags based on content focus
3. **Complexity Level**: Assign exactly one complexity level (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)
4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Add specialized tags for performance, architecture, etc.

### Quality Assurance
- **Consistency**: Use standardized tag names from this document
- **Completeness**: Every card must have Stage + Topic + Complexity tags
- **Accuracy**: Complexity level should match actual difficulty and interview context
- **Searchability**: Tag combinations should enable efficient content discovery

### Tag Evolution Strategy
- **Monthly Review**: Assess tag effectiveness and usage patterns
- **Content Growth**: Add new topic tags as content areas expand
- **User Feedback**: Adjust complexity classifications based on study experience
- **Interview Insights**: Refine tag priorities based on actual interview patterns
