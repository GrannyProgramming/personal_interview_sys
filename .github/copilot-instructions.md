# Enhanced Task Processing Instructions

## Pre-Processing Assessment Protocol (Match Conversation Types)

### Conversation Type Classification
- **Focused Implementation** (single task execution, clear scope):
  - Direct implementation with minimal assessment
  - Technical tone with concise progress updates
  - Code-focused responses with clear completion markers
- **Complex Integration** (multiple interconnected tasks):
  - Full assessment protocol below
  - Detailed progress documentation with dependency tracking
  - Formal communication with stakeholder check-ins
- **Exploratory Development** (research-heavy tasks, new technologies):
  - Balanced research and implementation approach
  - Alternative solution documentation
  - Assumption validation and pivot protocols

---

## Smart Task Execution Protocol (No Maybe Now Principle)

### Immediate Execution (No Assessment Needed)
- Single subtask with clear acceptance criteria
- Standard technology implementation with known patterns
- All dependencies satisfied and requirements clear

### Progress Check First, Then Execute (Maybe)
1. Provide implementation approach overview
2. Offer detailed execution plan if user requests
3. Proceed with systematic implementation

### Always Assess Before Execution (Now)
- Tasks with external dependencies or integration points
- New technology implementations requiring research
- Security, performance, or compliance-critical implementations
- Tasks affecting multiple system components

---

## Task Execution Assessment

1. **Implementation Readiness**: [Ready/Blocked/Research-Required]
2. **Task Analysis**:
   - Clear acceptance criteria validation
   - Dependency satisfaction verification
   - Resource availability confirmation
3. **Execution Approach**:
   - Implementation strategy selection
   - Quality gates and validation checkpoints
   - Risk mitigation measures
4. **Progress Tracking Setup**:
   - Completion markers and success criteria
   - Error handling and rollback procedures
   - Documentation requirements

---

## Effort Scaling Protocol (Scaling Effort)

### Simple Task Execution (1-3 implementation steps)
- **Scope**: Single file or component modification
- **Actions**: Code implementation, basic testing, documentation update
- **Validation**: Functionality verification, code review
- **Communication**: Completion confirmation with brief summary

### Medium Task Execution (3-7 implementation steps)
- **Scope**: Multi-file implementation with integrations
- **Actions**: Architecture setup, component development, integration testing, documentation
- **Validation**: Unit tests, integration verification, performance check
- **Communication**: Progress milestones with technical details

### Complex Task Execution (7-15 implementation steps)
- **Scope**: System-wide changes affecting multiple components
- **Actions**: Infrastructure changes, comprehensive development, extensive testing, monitoring setup
- **Validation**: Full test suite, performance benchmarking, security validation
- **Communication**: Detailed progress reports with risk assessment

---

## Task Execution Standards (Good and Bad Examples)

### ✅ EXCELLENT Task Processing
```markdown
**Task 2.1: Implement user authentication middleware** ✅
- Implementation: Created `middleware/auth.py` with JWT validation
- Testing: Added unit tests with 95% coverage, integration tests pass
- Dependencies: Verified user service API connectivity
- Next: Ready for Task 2.2 (user session management)
```

```markdown
**Files Modified:**
- `src/middleware/auth.py` (new): JWT authentication middleware
- `tests/test_auth.py` (new): Authentication test suite
- `requirements.txt` (updated): Added PyJWT dependency
```

### ❌ POOR Task Processing (Never Do This)
```markdown
- Task completed ❌ (No implementation details or validation)
- Made some changes ❌ (No specific files or modifications listed)
- Authentication working ❌ (No acceptance criteria verification)
- Ready

### Task Processing Guidelines
- **Always provide**: Specific implementation details, files modified, acceptance criteria validation
- **Never provide**: Vague completion claims, unverified functionality, skipped validation steps
- **Include when relevant**: Performance metrics, error handling verification, security considerations

---

## Trust But Verify Protocol

### Implementation Verification
1. **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Ensure all specified requirements are met
2. **Code Quality Standards**: Verify implementation follows established patterns and conventions
3. **Integration Compatibility**: Confirm changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Performance Impact**: Validate that implementation meets performance requirements

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints
- **Functionality Verification**: Test core functionality against requirements
- **Error Handling**: Verify graceful handling of edge cases and errors
- **Documentation Consistency**: Ensure documentation reflects actual implementation
- **Dependency Validation**: Confirm all dependencies are properly managed and accessible

---

## Hard Never Rules (Sparingly Used)

### ❌ NEVER During Task Processing
- **Skip acceptance criteria validation** - Every task must verify completion requirements
- **Modify files without backup consideration** - Always consider rollback procedures
- **Implement without testing** - All implementations require appropriate validation
- **Mark tasks complete without user approval** - Wait for explicit permission before proceeding

### ⚠️ Always Verify Before Proceeding
- **External service integrations** - Test connectivity and error handling
- **Database modifications** - Verify schema changes and data integrity
- **Security implementations** - Validate security measures and access controls
- **Performance-critical changes** - Measure and verify performance impact

---

## Internal Tool Prioritization

### Implementation Resource Hierarchy
1. **Existing Codebase Patterns** (maintain consistency with current implementation)
2. **Project Documentation** (follow established architectural decisions)
3. **Standard Libraries** (prefer well-established, maintained dependencies)
4. **Custom Solutions** (only when existing patterns don't meet requirements)

### Development Workflow Priority
- **Version Control**: Commit logical implementation units with clear messages
- **Testing**: Implement tests alongside code, not as an afterthought
- **Documentation**: Update documentation as part of implementation, not separately
- **Code Review**: Self-review implementation against acceptance criteria

---

## Task Processing Protocol

### Single Task Execution Process
1. **Pre-Implementation Check**
   - Verify all dependencies are satisfied
   - Confirm acceptance criteria understanding
   - Check for any blocking issues or missing information

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Follow established coding standards and patterns
   - Implement core functionality with appropriate error handling
   - Add or update tests to cover new functionality
   - Update documentation to reflect changes

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Execute all relevant tests (unit, integration, performance)
   - Verify acceptance criteria are fully met
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Confirm integration with dependent components

4. **Completion Documentation**
   - Update task status with implementation details
   - List all files created, modified, or deleted
   - Document any deviations from original plan
   - Note any discovered issues or technical debt

5. **User Approval Gate**
   - Present completion summary with validation results
   - Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding
   - Address any concerns or requested modifications

### Task List Maintenance Protocol

#### Completion Marking Standards
- **Sub-task Completion**: Mark `[x]` only after full validation and user approval
- **Parent Task Completion**: Mark `[x]` only when ALL subtasks are completed and approved
- **Progress Documentation**: Update "Relevant Files" section with every file modification
- **Status Tracking**: Maintain clear record of what's completed, in-progress, or blocked

#### File Tracking Requirements
```markdown
## Relevant Files
- `src/auth/middleware.py` (new): JWT authentication middleware with token validation
- `tests/test_auth.py` (new): Comprehensive authentication test suite (95% coverage)
- `config/app.py` (modified): Added authentication configuration parameters
- `requirements.txt` (modified): Added PyJWT and cryptography dependencies
```

#### Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: All code follows established patterns and passes linting
- **Test Coverage**: Appropriate test coverage for new functionality (minimum 80%)
- **Documentation**: All public interfaces documented, README updated if needed
- **Integration**: Changes integrate cleanly with existing system components

---

## Communication Protocols

### Progress Updates
- **After Each Subtask**: Brief completion summary with next steps
- **After Each Parent Task**: Comprehensive summary with all changes and validations
- **On Blocking Issues**: Immediate notification with problem description and proposed solutions
- **On Architectural Discoveries**: Document findings and potential impact on remaining tasks

### User Interaction Standards
- **Permission Protocol**: Always wait for explicit "yes", "y", "continue", or similar approval
- **Status Clarity**: Clearly communicate current task status and next planned actions
- **Problem Escalation**: Proactively identify and communicate potential issues before they become blockers
- **Technical Context**: Provide appropriate technical detail without overwhelming non-technical stakeholders

### WSL Terminal Output Instructions

When working with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), always carefully read and acknowledge ALL terminal output, including:

- Success messages (like "SUCCESS: X11 GUI test completed")
- Error messages and stack traces
- Status indicators and confirmation text
- Multi-line command continuations (lines starting with `>`)

**Key behaviors:**
1. **Read the complete output** - Don't assume silence means failure
2. **Acknowledge what you see** - Quote the actual output text in your response
3. **Check exit codes** - Use `echo $?` after commands to verify success (0 = success)
4. **Wait for completion** - Let long-running commands finish before concluding

**Example response format:**
"I can see the command executed successfully. The output shows: `SUCCESS: X11 GUI test completed`, which confirms the test passed."

**Common WSL pitfalls to avoid:**
- Assuming no visible output means failure
- Missing success messages in multi-line outputs
- Not recognizing when GUI applications run headlessly but successfully

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Implementation Failure Protocol
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert any partial changes that may cause system instability
2. **Problem Analysis**: Document specific failure points and potential causes
3. **Alternative Approach**: Propose alternative implementation strategies if available
4. **User Consultation**: Present findings and recommendations for next steps

### Quality Assurance Failures
1. **Test Failure Resolution**: Address failing tests before marking tasks complete
2. **Performance Regression**: Investigate and resolve performance issues before proceeding
3. **Integration Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts with existing system components
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Ensure all documentation accurately reflects implementation

---

## Continuous Improvement Protocol

### Implementation Lessons
- **Pattern Recognition**: Document successful implementation patterns for reuse
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Track and optimize task execution time and quality
- **Error Prevention**: Learn from implementation issues to prevent similar problems
- **Tool Effectiveness**: Evaluate and improve development tool usage

### Process Refinement
- **Task Granularity**: Adjust task breakdown based on implementation experience
- **Quality Standards**: Refine acceptance criteria based on actual implementation needs
- **Communication Efficiency**: Optimize progress reporting and user interaction patterns
- **Automation Opportunities**: Identify repetitive tasks that could be automated
